<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Giorgi, I am 25 and live in Batumi.</p>

<p>I finished school in 2017 and graduated from the Batumi State Maritime Academy in 2021.
  I always had an interest in computer science activities, so I started to learn web development in 2024,
  I really hope everything goes well with it and one day I'll be proud of it.</p>

<p>My hobbies are playing video games (who could have guessed?), reading books, playing and listening to music,
  visiting various festivals around the country, participating in local intellectual trivia games, watching sports
  and I think there is more but I can't think of any more at the moment.
</p>

<p>My favourite artist is Led Zeppelin, video game is Red Dead Redemption 2, favourite book is Les Mis√©rables by Victor Hugo,
  favourite sports is football(soccer) and club Barcelona.
</p>

<p>I am very curious person in general. I always ask a lot of questions about 
  how everything works.
  Curiosity is the greatest developer in humankind and not only, in my opinion. this is why I try to use it as much as I can which helped me become the person I am right now, 
  it will decide who I will become tomorrow and I will always use the curiosity to help anybody.
